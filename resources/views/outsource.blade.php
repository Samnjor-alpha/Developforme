                    <div class="why-us-col"><p>What is web outsourcing? This is a full or partial transfer of work to solve problems in the field of information technology, if they go beyond the main activity of the customer, but are necessary for the effective work of the organization. The responsibilities of the outsourcer, goals and objectives, as well as the deadlines for the execution of work are prescribed in a special agreement.</p>
                        <p>What is good outsourcing for the web project?</p>
                        <p>First, it allows you to save, and save at once in two directions: personnel and material. A full-time IT specialist often is not justified: the salary is usually higher than the cost of service. Regular employees tend to get sick and go on vacation, which entails the payment of sick leave and vacation leave.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="why-us-col"><p>In addition a company specializing in IT outsourcing works is cheaper and, unlike an IT specialist in the state, does not have the habit of going on vacation as a whole team.</p>
                        <p>The second advantage of working with an outsourcing company is the extensive experience of such organizations. As a rule, among the employees of such companies are real experts in their field. Thanks to this, it is possible to optimize the work process and minimize the intellectual as well as material costs.</p>
                        <p>The third advantage is efficiency. Thanks to the vast experience, the employees of the outsourcing company carry out their work as quickly and efficiently as possible. As practice shows, full-time specialists work more slowly and their decisions often differ for the worse.</p>
